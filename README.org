* emacs.d
  My Emacs configuration files and associated accoutrement. Works best
  for Python (specifically Django), Go, Rust, JavaScript and various
  devops tools (Docker, Terraform, Ansible).

** Installation

*** MacOS
    First, install Emacs from Homebrew using the [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]] package:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
    brew install d12frosted/emacs-plus/emacs-plus@28 --with-nobu417-big-sur-icon
    ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus@28/Emacs.app /Applications
    #+END_SRC

    Then, clone this repo to =~/.emacs.d=:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone https://github.com/ametzger/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
    #+END_SRC

    The first time Emacs starts it will fizzle around a while as
    =use-package= downloads and compiles packages.  Generally, startup
    is reasonably fast but it will start an Emacs server if one isn't
    running so using =emacsclient= as the shell's =$EDITOR= is usable.

*** Linux
    Nothing too fancy on Linux, usually I'll just use the =emacs=
    package of whatever distro I'm using.
